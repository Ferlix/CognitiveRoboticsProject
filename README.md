# CognitiveRoboticsProject
Project for group number 7


In this project we consider training a classifier X on feature histograms computed using the Global Orthographic Object Descriptor (GOOD) object descriptors and another descriptor X. 

We trained the classificator both
using active and offline learning. When training with active
learning uncertainty sampling was used as a querying strategy.
We use the Washington RGB-D dataset and
compared the results we found to results found in other papers
using the same dataset.
